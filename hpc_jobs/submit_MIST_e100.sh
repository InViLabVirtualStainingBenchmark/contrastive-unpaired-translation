# submit_MIST_e100.sh
# Submission wrapper for the two-part MIST-HER2 100-epoch training.
# Submits part 1, then submits part 2 with a SLURM dependency so that
# part 2 only starts if part 1 exits cleanly (no crash, no timeout).
#
# Usage (run from the repo root on the login node):
#   bash hpc_jobs/submit_MIST_e100.sh
#
# What happens:
#   1. Part 1 is submitted immediately and queued normally.
#   2. Part 2 is submitted with --dependency=afterok:<part1_jobid>.
#      It will sit in state "Pending (Dependency)" until part 1 finishes.
#      If part 1 fails or is cancelled, part 2 is automatically cancelled too.
#
# To check status:
#   squeue -u $USER
#
# To cancel both jobs if needed:
#   scancel <part1_jobid> <part2_jobid>
#
# After both jobs finish, submit inference:
#   sbatch hpc_jobs/infer_MIST-HER2_e100.sh
